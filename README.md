# React Feature Flag Starter

A simple react app using [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/) to demonstrate switching
between two features.

The application will switch 50/50 between two versions using a
randomly generated User ID stored in local storage.

To reset your ID, clear local storage and refresh your page; the app
will generate a new one.

### Development

```bash
# To develop
